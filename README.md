# R_Shiny_Top_Baby_Names

I created an R Shint app that visualizes top baby names. There are 4 tabs:
  1) Select the year for which you would like to see the most popular girl names
  2) Select the year for which you would like to see the most popular boy names
  3) Select a female name for which you would like to see popularity for
  4) Select a male name for which you would like to see popularity for
