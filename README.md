# R_Shiny_Top_Baby_Names

I created an R Shiny app that visualizes New Zealand's top male and female baby names for the years 1954-2018. There are 4 tabs:
  1) Select the year for which you would like to see the most popular girl names
  2) Select the year for which you would like to see the most popular boy names
  3) Select a female name for which you would like to see popularity for
  4) Select a male name for which you would like to see popularity for
